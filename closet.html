			<p>Fred manages to sneak into the closet unnoticed. He hears the intruder climb into his window. Then some more rustling of the tree outside and a second <i>thunk</i>. Then comes the wispering...</p>

      <p>He can barley make out their voices, but suddenly realizes that they are children's voices.</p>

      <p>"Is she gone?" the boy child says.</p>
      <p>"Yes, I think so. That was a close one. It looks like no one else is here. Let's just wait here until we are sure." says the girl child.
			<p> Fred thinks "These kids sound like they are running from someone. I wonder who that is. How annoying that they have to wake me up in the middle of the night, why did they chose to invade <emp>MY</emp> house?" What do you think Fred is going to do about this?

      <ul>
				<li><a href=scarekids.html>Make himself known. Whatever those pesky children are running from is probably an adult like Fred. Fred intends to bring them home to their parents and make sure they are properly punished.</a></li>
				<li><a href=continuehiding.html>Fred naturally is scared, even by something that children are running from. He continues to hide to figure out what they are running from.</a></li>
