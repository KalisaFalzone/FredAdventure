				<p>Our friend, Fred, is an IRS auditor. He wakes up without snoozing at 7:30 am, walks the 8 minutes and 30 seconds it takes to get to work, eats the same peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch, then leaves his cubicled office at precisely 5:00 pm. Fred shies away from all deviation and distraction...<em>except for tonight</em>...
