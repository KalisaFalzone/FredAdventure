			<p>"She must know we stole it from her, there's no way she would have followed us this far." says the boy</p>
      <p>"That must mean she knows what the necklace can do" says the girl. "Either way I think she is gone."</p>

        Fred wonders what they are talking about. He realizes that the kids are very scared and probably harmless. Luckily he is close enough to grab his trusty pepper spray anyway. He grabs that and sneaks up behind them.
